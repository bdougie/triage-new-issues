Today I went to the zoo. I saw a(n)
{{ ADJECTIVE_1 }}(adjective)
{{ NOUN_1 }}(Noun) jumping up and down in its tree.
He {{ VERB_PAST_TENSE_1 }}(verb, past tense) {{ ADVERB_1 }}(adverb)
through the large tunnel that led to its {{ ADJECTIVE_2 }}(adjective)
{{ NOUN_2 }}(noun). I got some peanuts and passed
them through the cage to a gigantic gray {{ ADJECTIVE_3 }}(noun)
towering above my head. Feeding that animal made
me hungry. I went to get a {{ ADJECTIVE_4 }}(adjective) scoop
of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to
{{ ADJECTIVE_5 }}(verb) {{ ADVERB_2 }} (adverb) to catch our bus.
When I got home I {{ VERB_PAST_TENSE_2 }}(verb, past tense) my
mom for a {{ ADJECTIVE_5 }}(adjective) day at the zoo.
